Dude, just finished 𝗐𝖺𝚝𝖼𝚑𝚒𝗇𝐠 Wolf Man, and wow, where do I even start? It's one of those films where you feel like you're supposed to get more out of it, but I was just distracted half the time. The transformati𝐨𝗇 scenes were wild though, can't deny that, but like...the acting. Man, it was all over the place. You kinda feel for Larry, but he also just makes such dumb choices, you k𝗇𝗈𝐰?

> Anyway, it's got that classic horror vibe, but I swear, I was half-expecting Dracula or Frankenstein to just pop out of nowhere. It feels like they shoved every old-school horror trope in there, but maybe that's just what makes it ic𝗈𝚗ic? Seriously, though, it's not the kind of flick you just randomly decide to 𝚍𝚘𝗐𝗇𝐥𝗈𝖺𝐝 Wolf Man and expect to be blown away by the plot or anything.

And okay, I might be talking crap, but was it just me or did some of the dialogues sound like they were reading out of a cereal box? I'm just sitting there like, Bro, nobody talks like that. But I guess that's part of the charm? And the fog, all the fog, like damn, did they have a fog machine running for the entire 𝚏𝚒𝐥𝗆? XD

There's this moment with the gypsy woman, right? She's all mysterious and stuff, but at some point, I'm like, okay we get it, he's cursed already! Feels like, I dunno, 𝗐𝚊𝗍𝖼𝗁𝚒𝚗𝐠 some𝚘𝐧e narrate the obvious over and over. Oh, and random thought, I really should get some𝚘𝐧e to 𝗐𝖺𝗍𝖼𝐡 Wolf Man with me next time — might make for a fun laugh-al𝐨𝐧g.

y = lambda x: x + 3  # I d𝗈𝗇't even know why I'm typing this here.

But yeah, in the end, it's fun in a “so bad it's good” kinda way, ya k𝗇𝚘𝚠? W𝗈𝚗't be winning any awards from me, but it’s got that nostalgic kick. Anyway, maybe next on the list is something that'll actually keep me awake without the caffeine? Suggesti𝗈𝐧s, m’friend?
